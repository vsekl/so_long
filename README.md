# So Long
This project is a very small 2D game.  
Its purpose is to make me work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements.  
So Long improved my skills in the following areas: window management,
event handling, colors, textures, animation and so forth.
# The Game
• The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.  
• The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.  
• The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.  
• The player should not be able to move into walls.  
• At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.  
• 2D view.  
• The game doesn’t have to be real time.
